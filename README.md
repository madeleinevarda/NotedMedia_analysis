# NotedMedia - Sales Performance Analysis 

Noted Media is developing Noted University, an educational platform for artists that will launch within two years, with a specific focus on Web3 music transaction data. By collaborating with the head of technology, I will examine metrics including total revenue, average order value (AOV), leading assets, and buyer behavior across musical genres. The findings will be shared on the company's Discord and with the CEO to inform Noted University's strategic direction.

# Deep-Dive Insights 

## Overview 

The Web3 music NFT market represents a surprisingly small fraction of overall NFT activity, accounting for less than 1% of transactions in our comprehensive dataset of 5.25 million NFT purchases. While music NFTs are occasionally bundled with art pieces or collectibles, these combinations remain relatively rare in the broader NFT landscape. Our analysis reveals an interesting breakdown of NFT ownership patterns: only 5,721 collectors exclusively own music NFTs, while 3,568 owners have diversified their portfolios to include both music and other NFT categories. In stark contrast, 608,043 collectors hold NFTs with no connection to music, highlighting the nascent state of music NFTs in the current Web3 ecosystem.

## Sales Trends 

* February (226%) and March (66%) showed exceptional revenue spikes, warranting investigation into specific growth drivers.
* March had high transaction volume (7,409) but a significantly lower average order value ($422) compared to February's $1,889, indicating a substantial shift in purchasing behavior or pricing strategy.
* Music NFT collectors show distinct spending patterns: those focused exclusively on music NFTs spend $64 less per transaction compared to multi-category NFT collectors.  

## Leading Assets 

* Established Web2 artists dominate the Web3 music space, with Shawn Mendes accounting for 50% of top-performing assets.
* Kings of Leon's 8% market share and 34,334,700 sales (compared to the second-place asset's 122,889) stem from their established Web2 presence and media coverage of their "NFT Yourself" release, which positioned the NFT as the exclusive way to listen to the album.
* The top ten assets, predominantly pop and electronic genres, comprise 46% of all transactions, demonstrating the market's concentration around a small number of high-volume assets.

# Recommendations 

* Have your Web3 artists establish a presence on traditional streaming platforms to increase their audience reach and potentially collaborate with Web2 artists.
* Target and incentivize cross-category collectors through strategic NFT pairings, such as bundling music NFTs with art NFTs or offering customizable art options, as these collectors demonstrate higher average spending and represent a significant portion of high-value transactions. 
* Time your NFT releases strategically, investigating the market conditions that drove February's exceptional performance to potentially replicate its success. 
* Prioritize electronic and pop genres for initial releases, as these demonstrate stronger market performance.

# Limitations and Future Changes 

The current dataset presented dimensional constraints, primarily offering transactional metrics without deeper contextual information. To enhance analytical depth, I augmented the data by manually categorizing musical genres and conducting detailed research into the top 10 assets' presence across streaming platforms, media coverage, and accessibility.

Future analysis would benefit significantly from enhanced customer demographic data, including age distributions, gender breakdowns, and broader purchasing patterns. This demographic insight would enable more targeted marketing strategies and better understanding of the ideal customer profile for music NFTs. Additionally, while I observed some patterns in cross-category purchasing behavior, a more comprehensive analysis of NFT category relationships could reveal optimal pairing strategies for music NFTs.
